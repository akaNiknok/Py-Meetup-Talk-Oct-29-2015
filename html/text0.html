<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p><font color="#000000">Please let me introduce myself, My name is Austin G Imperial, I started coding when I was 11yrs old without no idea that I was actually coding. It all started from an online Windows game. I got curious on how a particular hack worked, so I asked this person who made the hack on how he did it, luckily because of my eagerness to learn, we exchanged emails and he taught me how to edit a special file type that the game used called SQF using only a “notepad” [until we discovered sublime text]. My curiosity led me to modifying an XML file for another game named Spin Tires. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">I am not here to teach you the technical sides of Python which I am sure you are far better than I am but rather share my ideas and thoughts on how to start your own personal projects in Python.</font></p>
