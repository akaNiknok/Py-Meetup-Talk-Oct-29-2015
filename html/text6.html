<h1><font color="#FFFFFF">How do you make a useful code?</font></h1>
<h2>To make a personal project, you need to have the following:</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Idea</b></li>
<li><b>Problem</b></li>
<li><b>Solution</b></li>
<li><b>Inspiration</b></li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p><b>idea</b> = this is my biggest problem.  you're stuck at doing nothing without an idea on what to do, you can not have a solution to any problem without having first a “pyidea” :-)</p>
<p><b>problem</b> = what could be the possible problem for you to solve and exercise your brain muscles</p>
<p><b>solution</b> = so you have a problem, then go figure how to solve it, make a flow chart or pseudo code like what I have found in wikipedia for my last project, sudoku solver &lt;insert example in solving the sudoku solver (backtracking)&gt;, use your imagination</p>
<p><b>inspiration</b> = I do not know the reason why you need an inspiration, but most adults suggest that “success is 99% perspiration and 1%inspiration”, you should all know this that I am not responsible with this quote, maybe when this quote was written an airconditioner was still unheard of :-)</p>
